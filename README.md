# Nurmi
Nurmi is a Modular framework for testing and everyday operations based on simple small and independent steps.

## Ancient History
The greatest pride of Swedish naval warfare was a huge warship ship called Vasa, which sank in the Stockolm harbour after seiling only roughly 1300 meters in 1628.

In 1961 when Swedish marine archealogists decided to salvage the wreck of the ship, a group of finnish technology unversity students dived on the ship the night before and placed there a small statue of finnish runner Paavo Nurmi engraved with text in latin "Paavo Nurmi, the Great Finnish Runner".

Apparently the statue is still in the inventory of Vasa museum in Stockholm.
